        <p  style="text-indent:0"> The <span>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers — Sensors Council</span> has recognized Professor Mona Jarrahi with the Technical Achievement Award in Sensors — Advanced Career. The IEEE Sensors Council focuses on the theory, design, fabrication, manufacturing, and application of devices for sensing and transducing physical, chemical, and biological phenomena, with an emphasis on the electronics, physics, and reliability aspects of sensors and integrated sensor-actuators. IEEE Sensors Council serves the sensor community with its well-recognized publications, conferences, and technical committees.</p>
        <p>The IEEE is the world\'s largest technical professional organization. IEEE's roots go back to 1884, with names such as  Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell and founding President Norvin Green of Western Union. It saw technologies evolve from the telegraph, telephone, electric power, radio, and modern globalized communication systems of today. It has over 400,000 members in 160 countries. <span>www.ieee.org </span></p>
