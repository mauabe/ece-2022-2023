A design team headed by assistant manager and engineer Donald Frey was formed and the new project was titled the “T-5”. After some consideration it was agreed that a cross breed roadster and Ford Falcon would be more suitable to modern demands. After all, the Ford Thunderbird, which was Ford’s most recent two seater car, did not fair as well as expected in current car markets. The T-5 was given a new design commission and Lee Iacocco gives much credit to the efforts of stylist David Ash for making the renamed “Mustang” a smashing success.</p><p>    In 1964 production was in high gear for the newly designed 1965 Ford Mustang. The highly anticipated Ford Mustang was honored by being named the Indianapolis pace car of 1964 and Ford stepped it up to accommodate the rising status of their new design. A special convertible version was adapted as the pacer. It was manufactured in white with a blue stripe on the hood and trunk. Ford also made 230 extra pace cars, available in convertible and hard top. The 64 1/2 convertibles had a 289cid engine, and the hardtops came with the less powerful 260 V-8. Thirty five convertibles were sold to dealerships and 195 hardtops were given out in dealer contests held in April of 1964.</p><p>    Clearly the new Ford Mustang was suddenly everywhere! It was even featured in 1964’s Bond movie, Goldfinger! Yes, the Mustang was an instant hit! A true royal gem in Ford’s car making history. It was the most successful release Ford had made since the 1928 introduction of the Model A and it has stood the test of time. Ford is still continuing the Mustang line and even the newer Mustangs are a modern collectors item. </p> '

    textCopy: '<p style="text-indent:0"><span class="first-letter">A</span>chuta Kadambi, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering, has received the Outstanding Young Professional Award from the honor society Eta Kappa Nu of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).<p/><p>Established in 1936, the award recognizes outstanding engineers who are under 35 years of age with exceptional career accomplishments. Kadambi, who also has a faculty appointment in computer science, was selected for his “contributions to creative and inclusive teaching and mentoring in electrical engineering and bioengineering.” <p/><p> Kadambi leads the Visual Machines Group at UCLA, which focuses on building computational imaging systems with applications in robotics and health care. Through his research, Kadambi aims to address implicit biases in medical and other devices and to explore pragmatic solutions. Separate from his work at UCLA, Kadambi also co-founded Akasha Imaging, a commercial imaging technology company.<p/><p> Prof. Kadambi has been named this year’s recipient of the IEEE-HKN young professional award. Beginning in 1936, the IEEE-HKN has awarded a maximum of one award per year to an electrical engineer under 35 years of age. Previous winners have gone on to win the Nobel Prize, National Medal of Science, and include tenured faculty at Stanford and MIT. <p/><p> Kadambi is the first UCLA winner in recent years. His key inventions include new types of circuits that adapt to the variability of human beings. This enables life-saving devices like medical devices to be more inclusive to people of different skin types, sexes, or ages. Kadambi is currently working with Dr. Laleh Jalilian, a medical school faculty at UCLA, to deploy the research to patients.<p/><p> “The most enjoyable part of research is the students I get to work with. Since I started as a faculty, PhD students Pradyumna Chari has been a sounding board for these problems, and has been joined by PhD students Sasha Vilesov and Ellin Zhao. This project is also not possible without the rigorous clinical collaboration of UCLA medical school faculty Dr. Laleh Jalilian,” said Prof. Kadambi. <p/><p> When asked about the direction of the research in the future, he stated: “We are placing a bet that 21st century society demands that life-saving medical devices work for all humans, not just a subset. If this bet is correct, I envision research like ours will be a critical part of future products that are deployed in hospitals.”<p/><p>  Remote Heart Rate Sensors Can be Biased Against Darker Skin. A UCLA Team Offers a Solution. <p/><p> As telemedicine has grown more popular, so have devices that allow people to measure their vital signs from home and transmit the results by computer to their doctors. Yet in many cases, obtaining accurate remote readings for people of color has proved a persistent challenge.<p/><p>Take remote heart rate measurements, for example, which rely on a camera sensing subtle changes in the color of a patient’s face caused by fluctuations in the flow of blood beneath their skin. These devices, part of an emerging class of remote technologies, consistently have trouble reading color changes in people with darker skin tones, said Achuta Kadambi, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering.<p/><p>Kadambi and his team have now developed a remote diagnostic technique that overcomes this implicit bias against darker skin while also making heart rate readings more accurate for patients across the full range of skin tones. Their secret? Combining the light-based measurements of a camera with radio-based measurements from radar.<p/><p>The researchers presented their findings, recently published in the journal ACM Transactions on Graphics, at the SIGGRAPH 2022 conference in Vancouver, British Columbia. The conference, held both virtually and in-person, is organized annually by members of the Association for Computing Machinery.<p/><p>The advance could lead to new classes of high-performing medical devices and remote technologies that are more accurate and equitable, the researchers said, allowing doctors and health care systems to remotely monitor patients with confidence, both in clinical settings and from patients’ homes. “In the larger picture, this work shows that practical and innovative engineering solutions can address persistent biases in medical devices,” said Kadambi, who is also a member of the California NanoSystems Institute at UCLA. “But that first requires an acknowledgement that such bias means the current best technology may not be the best for everyone. Through thoughtful design, we can find equitable solutions that perform as well or better.”<p/><p>The UCLA team’s fusion of two techniques shows a promising path toward achieving those goals, said Kadambi, who is also an assistant professor of computer science and principal investigator on the research. As head of the Visual Machines Group at UCLA, he has written about different types of biases in medical devices and how to fix them.<p/><p>In developing their new technology, the researchers first showed that the remote sensing device itself was the source of the bias, demonstrating in their paper that higher levels of melanin, natural pigments in the skin, interfere with what is known as the photoplethysmography, or PPG, signal that is used in current camera-based remote heart rate measurements.<p/><p>PPG signaling is also used to measure heart rate through devices like pulse oximeters, which clamp onto a patient’s finger, as well as some wearable commercial products and smartwatch-powered apps. These devices emit light onto the skin and sense changes in the amount of light reflected back by circulating blood just below the surface. That reflected light produces the PPG signal, a measure of a patient’s heart rate.<p/><p>Previous efforts to address skin tone biases in such technologies have generally looked to correct them through additional programming or by expanding baseline standards using a more diverse range of skin tones. But neither of these approaches target the real issue, Kadambi said, which is the physics of the device itself.<p/><p>The UCLA researchers instead turned to another technology that can give an estimate of heart rate: radar. At 77 gigahertz, radar can sense subtle changes in the displacement of the chest from heartbeats. And while this method overcomes the issue of skin tone bias, it is less reliable than PPG signaling. However, they found success by combining these two different modes of sensing — camera and radar — and refining them through machine learning to work in concert.<p/><p>  A senior member of the National Academy of Inventors, Kadambi has also been honored with a Young Faculty Award from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), a National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER Award, an Army Research Office Young Investigator Award and a Google Faculty award. In 2019, he was named to Forbes’ “30 Under 30” list for science.<p/><p> IEEE is the world’s largest technical professional organization with more than 423,000 members worldwide. The 2022 Eta Kappa Nu awards, including three additional categories, was presented at the IEEE Educational Activities Board Awards & Recognition Ceremony Nov. 18 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. </p> </p> '
